The morning was spent configuring Pelican to provide me with the simplest, most minimal blog I could manage. It serves up static files, and seems to work for the most part. I'll add a few embellishments here or there a little later. I just needed a place to think. So this post is going to contain a whole bunch of markup and perhaps annoying elements that I can refer back to for a quick template. Also, I may add my previous blog posts from the defunct github blog I tried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well it's an imperfect creature, and by the time anyone reads this post, that won't be the case. So, Let's get to work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I'm finsihing out Harry Percival's 'Obey the Testing Goat!', and then I'm going to jump into some Flask development. I want to get a good idea about how each framework works. Right now, Django seems to hide more away so you can focus on bigger project ideas, whereas Flask let's you switch out alot of the moving parts that Django takes for granted. They each have their uses, but being a small developer right now, I can see clearer and work more deliberatley with Flask. Looking at the list of Apps I want to make, they're small and not really meant to scale up. So, I want to see what Flask has to offer there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="初め！"></category><category term="beginnings"></category><category term="pelican"></category><category term="markdown"></category></entry><entry><title>An Awesome post</title><link href="/an_awesome_post.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-12T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-04-12T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Dwaine A.
